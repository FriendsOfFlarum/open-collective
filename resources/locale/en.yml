      use_legacy_api_key_help: >
        If you have a legacy API key, you may keep using it, but it is recommended to switch to a Personal Token.
        Currently, personal tokens seem to work in API Key mode (i.e. "API-Key" header), but this is not documented.

      api_key_label: Application API Key (deprecated)
      api_key_help: This authentication method is deprecated. Please consider switching to a Personal Token.

      personal_token_label: Personal Token
      personal_token_help: Create a personal token at <a>https://opencollective.com/applications</a>. This token is used to fetch your backer information from Open Collective.

      slug_label: Collective Slug
      slug_help: Enter your Open Collective collective slug (the part after opencollective.com/ in your collective URL).

      group_label: Group to Assign
      group_help: Select which Flarum user group backers should be added to. Users will be automatically added when they become backers and removed when they stop backing.
